"""
This function executes a classical rewriting
algorithm on a Julia expression `ex`. Classical rewriting
applies rule in order with a fixed point iteration:

This algorithm heavily relies on
[RuntimeGeneratedFunctions.jl](https://github.com/SciML/RuntimeGeneratedFunctions.jl)
and the [MatchCore](https://github.com/SciML/RuntimeGeneratedFunctions.jl)
pattern matcher.
**NOTE**: this does not involve the use of [`EGraphs.EGraph`](@ref) or
equality saturation ([`EGraphs.saturate!`](@ref)).
When using `rewrite`, be aware of infinite loops:
Since rules are matched in order in every iteration, it
is possible that commonly used symbolic rules such as commutativity
or associativity of operators may cause this algorithm to
have a cycling computation instantly. This algorithm
detects cycling computation by keeping an history of hashes,
and instantly returns when a cycle is detected.

This algorithm is suitable for simple, deterministic symbolic rewrites.
For more advanced use cases, where it is needed to apply multiple
rewrites at the same time, or it is known that rules are causing loops,
please use [`EGraphs.EGraph`](@ref) and
equality saturation ([`EGraphs.saturate!`](@ref)).
